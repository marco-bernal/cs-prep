### Interview Preparation 

This repo should be the source of truth when it comes to Algorithms and DS
for interview prep.

#### TODO: 
* Move out the qualified package to a different repo. Something like 'rest-service-primer'.
* Extract algorithms from packages: ca, mxbe, se and put them in the algorithms package.
* Add a note in the class if the algorithm was asked in a real interview, don't disclose what company asks for it.
* Group classes in the algorithms package based on the 6-8 patters to solve them:
    * Slide window, 2 pointers, subset and so on.
* Keep adding more algorithms as iPrep for FAANG, based on leecode and other resources.
* For all the algorithms:
    * Add detailed explanation of the problem, input and output examples.
    * Add detailed solving approaches: brute force and optimal solution with time and space complexities.
    * Improve them by implementing Streams, enhanced for each loops and the Collections Framework.

* Move out classes from the algorithms and data-structures repositories. Add them here in their corresponding packages
and delete those repos.
